# atUtility
* this library is a collection of useful functions of my Arduino projects combined in one class for easy use.
* it's partially written with more modern C++ features like templates and lambda functions. I also work with references and pointers. For this reason it's not possible to use the library through the library manager of the Arduino IDE. You have to download the source code and include it in your project.

If you want to use this library you only have to clone this repository into your Arduino library folder. The library is tested with Arduino CLI in combination with VSCode.
